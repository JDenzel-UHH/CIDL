Other covariates (X6–X9, V1–V5) can and should be used for adjustment, modeling, and exploration of effect heterogeneity, and in principle one can define subgroup SATTs based on them as well. However, for these additional subgroup estimands no official ground-truth values are available, so their performance cannot be validated in the same way as for the X1–X5-based subgroups."
